Consider P1(a,b) and P2(c,d) to be two points on a 2D plane.

a happens to equal the minimum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).

b happens to equal the minimum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).

c happens to equal the maximum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).

c happens to equal the maximum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).

Query the Manhattan Distance between points and and round it to a scale of decimal places.

Input Format:

The STATION table is described as follows:
